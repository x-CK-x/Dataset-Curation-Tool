# Dataset-Curation-Tool

A tool for downloading from public image boards (which allow scraping) / preview your images & tags / edit your tags. Additional tabs for downloading other desired code repositories as well as S.O.T.A. Diffusion and Clip models for your purposes. Custom datasets can be added!

## WIKI-Page / Tutorial for this Repository [HERE](https://github.com/x-CK-x/Dataset-Curation-Tool/wiki)

![General Config](https://github.com/x-CK-x/Dataset-Curation-Tool/blob/74f6877383bddfd9c0d8e9587ab983e63936f89f/wiki_assets/v4WebUI_page_1_tab_1.png)

## Installation Requirements

Make sure you have `git` installed!

> Download either the windows, mac, or linux run file (repo will be installed for you):
> 
> [Windows Download](https://github.com/x-CK-x/Dataset-Curation-Tool/blob/main/run.bat)
> 
> [Linux Download](https://github.com/x-CK-x/Dataset-Curation-Tool/blob/main/linux_run.sh)
> 
> [MacOS Download](https://github.com/x-CK-x/Dataset-Curation-Tool/blob/main/mac_run.sh)

> Mac and Linux Users should make the file executable with the following terminal command:
```
chmod +x linux_run.sh
```

OR

```
chmod +x mac_run.sh
```

#### Other System Install Options
- Unzip for the (optionally) downloaded zip files

(Linux)
```
sudo apt-get install unzip
```

## How to Run Program

### "DO NOT" run the file with admin/sudo perms!
### "DO NOT" put the manually downloaded run file from the (INSTALLATION STEP ^^^) in the Data-Curation-Tool folder!
### "DO NOT" use the run file/s in the Data-Curation-Tool folder! (Use the manually downloaded run file, from the INSTALLATION STEP ^^^ to install and/or update the repo)
### "DO NOT" move the generated "dataset_curation_path.txt" file out of the Data-Curation-Tool folder!
```
The "DUPLICATE" run files (run.bat, mac_run.sh, linux_run.sh) residing in the Data-Curation-Tool folder, are intentionally deleted when the program is run.
```

> Double-Click file to run with (Default) settings

> Update dependencies i.e. in the yaml file with the following (make sure to use the most recent yaml file in the repo: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-CK-x/Dataset-Curation-Tool/main/environment.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-CK-x/Dataset-Curation-Tool/main/environment.yml)):
```
./RUN_FILE --update
```

### Below are Several Run (additional) Options to choose from

> Run with sharing turned on : Provides a *live* link that anyone can use
```
./RUN_FILE --share
```

> Run password protected : Requires user to type in a username & password to access the webUI
```
./RUN_FILE --server_port 7860 --username NAME --password PASS
```

> Run on a specified PORT : Displays the webUI relative to a specified PORT
```
./RUN_FILE --server_port 7860
```

> OR CHOOSE ANY COMBINATION OF ^

## Important Information

- the most current **STABLE** build --> [v4.4.6](https://github.com/x-CK-x/Dataset-Curation-Tool/releases/tag/v4.4.6)
- for new users, it's highly recommended to use releases instead of pulling from the main branch
- in addition it is important to avoid using the **alpha** builds in the [releases](https://github.com/x-CK-x/Dataset-Curation-Tool/releases)
- if an alpha build is present it will be labeled as a **pre-release** and the **main-branch** of the repo is also likely to contain those changes; as such please use the most recent stable build as denoted above

## Additional Information

##### Default folder directory tree
```
base_folder/
├─ batch_folder/
│  ├─ downloaded_posts_folder/
│  │  ├─ png_folder/
│  │  ├─ jpg_folder/
│  │  ├─ gif_folder/
│  │  ├─ webm_folder/
│  │  ├─ swf_folder/
│  ├─ resized_img_folder/
│  ├─ tag_count_list_folder/
│  │  ├─ tags.csv
│  │  ├─ tag_category.csv
│  ├─ save_searched_list_path.txt
```
Any file path parameter that are empty will use the default path.

Files/folders that use the same path are merged, not overwritten. For example, using the same path for save_searched_list_path at every batch will result in a combined searched list of every batch in one .txt file.

### Notes
* When downloading, if the file already exists, it is skipped, unless, the file exists but was modified, it will download and the modified file will be renamed. Hence, I recommend not setting `delete_original` to `true` if you plan redownloading using the same destination folder.
* When resizing, when `resized_img_folder` uses a different folder from the source folder, if the file in the destination folder already exists, it is skipped. It does not check if the already existing file has the specified `min_short_side`.
* When running a new batch using the same save directories for tag files, tag count folders, and save_searched_list, tag files, tag count csvs, and save_searched_lists will be overwritten.
